AirCentral API
====

Background
---
This is the core AirJukebox API service, which will be hosted on the public
Internet.  It is a RESTful HTTP web service, written in Python and using the
CherryPy web framework.

The service also utilizes a back-end instance of the open source Apache Solr
search engine; this provides persistent storage for channels and song requests,
and search services over this data.

Required Packages:
---
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
sudo apt-get install python python-dev
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

Installation
---
The service is most easily run from the command-line using a Python 'virtualenv'
environment.  The steps to get the service running under a typical Linux
distribution are given below:

# python virtual environment and dependencies
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
easy_install cherrypy psycopg2 solrpy

# backend solr service
cd solr
java -jar start.jar

# api service
python service.py
